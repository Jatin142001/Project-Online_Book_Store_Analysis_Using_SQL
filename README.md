# SQL - Project: Online Book Store Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an Online Book Store using SQL. It involves creating a structured database and extracting valuable insights through various SQL queries. The analysis covers book details, customer data, and order transactions to derive meaningful business insights.

## Project Structure
 
### Database Design

Tables Created:
  Books – Stores book details (title, author, genre, price, stock, etc.).
  Customers – Contains customer information (name, email, location, etc.).
  Orders – Holds order details (order date, quantity, total amount, etc.).

### Key SQL Queries & Insights

 1. Retrieve books by genre, publication year, and price.
 2. Identify best-selling books and high-spending customers.
 3. Analyze stock availability and revenue trends.
 4. Track customer orders and purchasing patterns.

### Key Insights from the Analysis

1. The best-selling book was identified by counting the most frequently ordered book.
2. The most valuable customers were determined based on their total spending.
3. The total revenue was calculated by summing up all order amounts.
4. The lowest and highest-priced books were retrieved using sorting functions.
5. The remaining stock levels were analyzed after fulfilling orders.

###  SQL Techniques Used
1. Joins: Used INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN to connect books, orders, and customers
2. Aggregations: Used SUM(), COUNT(), AVG() for revenue and sales insights
3. Sorting & Filtering: Used ORDER BY, HAVING, DISTINCT for refined data analysis
4. Subqueries: Applied for advanced queries and filtering
5. Grouping Data: Used GROUP BY for genre-wise and customer-wise insights

### Conclusion
The Online Book Store Analysis project demonstrates the power of SQL in data analysis and database management. By designing a structured database and executing various SQL queries, we extracted valuable insights related to book availability, customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue generation.
This project not only enhanced SQL skills in querying, filtering, and aggregating data but also provided a real-world approach to understanding how businesses can leverage databases for decision-making.
